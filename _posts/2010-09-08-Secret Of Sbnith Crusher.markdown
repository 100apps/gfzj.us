Secret Of Sbnith Crusher


Welcome to our home page.My name is **Sbnith**,I've lived in the Mars with my People for about 3M years.Long time ago, our ancestors invented *Cursher*,a tool which crush the stone and make them small enough to cook and eat.And now,i'm proudly to announce that i've invent a crusher different from the formers.for short,we just call it *sbnith crusher*. now,i'll describe it as clearly as i can,especially to you who live in the earth and use [Google][].


What is sbnith crusher


![sbnith crusher's shape][sbnith crusher_s shape] A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks, gravel, or rock dust. Crushers may be used to reduce the size, or change the form, of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled, or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore), so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated[\[1\]][1]. And sbnith is the inventor's name.As a human beings in the earth,you may heard of *gyratory crusher*,*jaw crusher*,*bone crusher*,*wesley crusher*,*beverly crusher*,*head crusher*,*psycho crusher* and so many crushers.Today you know another crusher called sbnith crusher.As you can see in the picture,the machine eat stone and output smaller and more uniform gravel.So we can eat them easily.I heart that people in the earth chew food by their Teeth and tongue,which is a rather laborious work.This is also and evidence shows that we Mars people is smarter than them. Factors Influencing Crusher Performance IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE for a crusher to choke at some other point in the crushing chamber than the theoretical choke-point. When the setting of a fine-reduction crusher is too close for its eccentric throw and for the general proportions of its crushing chamber, there is a tendency toward building up a choke in the zone immediately above discharge opening, regardless of where the theoretical choke-point is located. The reason for this is that the excessive movement of the head (in relation to the discharge setting) mashes the material against the concave so tightly that the individual particles are shattered, or pulverized. Such a crushing action builds up fines very rapidly, and consequently brings about a rapid reduction in the percentage of voids, even though the crushing chamber may have a progressive volume-expansion characteristic. Many materials, when mashed in the manner described, tend to cake, and to cling to the crushing surfaces; the movement becomes sluggish; more material crowds down from above, aggravating the packed condition, and, if the action progresses to the point where all voids are eliminated, a choke results.


Design of sbnith crusher


An industrial application is described where a self-tuning regulator is used for control of a sbnith crusher. There are difficult control problems associated with this process due to significant variations in operating conditions and long time delays in the system. The design of a self-tuning regulator for the crusher is discussed in detail. During this case study a temporary digital control loop was set up. A process computer at the University of Lund was connected to the ore crushing plant at 1800 km distance. When a self-tuning regulator is applied to a process with constant but unknown parameters, it will under certain conditions converge to a minimum variance strategy. The parameters of the ore crusher can hardly be considered as constant. However, it has been demonstrated practically that the use of exponential forgetting in the parameter estimation performed in the algorithm will give a very good regulator for the crusher. star, openThe original version of this paper was presented at the IFAC Symposium on Stochastic Control which was held in Budapest, Hungary, during September 1974. The published Proceedings of this IFAC meeting may be ordered from: 4th International Conference on Digital Computer Applications to Process Control, IFAC/IFIP Conference, Gloriastrasse 35, CH-8006 Zurich[\[2\]][2].The design of the machine,more or less mimics the human chew actions. The motor drives the belt wheel, and makes movable jaw up and down by eccentric shaft. When the movable jaw rises, the angle between the fixed jaw and movable jaw gets larger, and the materials can be crushed to reach the crushing target. When the movable jaw is down, the angle between the fixed jaw and movable jaw becomes smaller. The movable jaw plate leaves the fixed jaw plate under the function of drawbar and spring, and then the crushed materials are discharged from the lower outlet of the crushing cavity.Let's see the wheel at last.The wheel, invented by the Sumerians (in modern Iraq) 3000 BC, represented the most important advances in transportation. When you know that 80% of human activities for transport, we guess its importance. But the wheel, to adjust the field, presented by the following numerous variants.


Performance


Sbnith crushers are used by both the aggregate producing and the mining industry. Both industries are interested in increasing the product quality while at the same time lowering the production costs. Prediction of crusher performance has been focused on, since crushing is a vital process for both industries. In the thesis a method for prediction of Sbnith crusher performance is presented. The model is based on the laws of mechanics and constitutive relations concerning rock breakage characteristics. There are some crucial assumptions which are of central interest for the model. The validity of these assumptions has been verified by full-scale tests. The overall size reduction process is a result of several subsequent crushing events. Therefore, the process occurring in a Sbnith crusher must also be modelled in the same repetitive way. Each crushing event is modelled with a selection and a breakage function. Selection corresponds to the probability of a particle being broken when an aggregate of particles is compressed. Breakage represents the way a single particle is broken into smaller fragments. The appearance of the selection and breakage functions is rock material specific and can be obtained by laboratory tests. The characterization of the fragmentation behaviour for rock materials is done by form conditioned compression crushing tests. Two modes of breakage are possible to achieve in a Sbnith crusher. The location of the choke level is the criterion which determines the breakage mode. Interparticle breakage is achieved above the choke level while only single particle breakage is achieved below this level. The crusher model takes the fragmentation behaviour of the rock and feed size distribution into consideration. Moreover, chamber and machine geometry, together with machine parameters such as closed side setting, stroke and eccentric speed, is accounted for. On all occasions continuity of mass is preserved. Three main factors are identified to promote the size reduction process occurring in a Sbnith crusher. These factors are: breakage modes, number of crushing zones, and compression ratio. The main factors are affected by both design and operating parameters. For a given crusher, the factors depend on eccentric speed, closed side setting, rock material breakage characteristics and feed size distribution. The main factors provide a fundamental and detailed understanding of how a Sbnith crusher operates. Any design consideration should be evaluated against these main factors. The model can be used as a simulation tool to assist in the design process of crushers. Any arbitrary design can then be studied. If a set of simulations is performed for a given crusher, a Crusher Performance Map is achieved, which in turn can be used when optimizing a given crushing task or a crushing plant.


How to Use


Oh!it's so easy to handle it.just like human beings eat food,feed the crusher then you can eat what it outputs.
