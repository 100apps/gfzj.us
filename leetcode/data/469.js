Please think why does it work before read my explanation.\\n\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int findComplement(int num) {\\n        return ~num & ((Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAccording to the problem, the result is\\n1. The ```flipped``` version of the original ```input``` but\\n2. Only flip ```N``` bits within the range from ```LEFTMOST``` bit of ```1``` to ```RIGHTMOST```. \\nFor example input = ```5``` (the binary representation is ```101```), the ```LEFTMOST``` bit of ```1``` is the third one from ```RIGHTMOST``` (```100```, ```N``` =  3). Then we need to flip 3 bits from ```RIGHTMOST``` and the answer is ```010```\\n\\nTo achieve above algorithm, we need to do 3 steps:\\n1. Create a bit mask which has ```N``` bits of ```1``` from ```RIGHTMOST```. In above example, the mask is ```111```. And we can use the decent Java built-in function ```Integer.highestOneBit``` to get the ```LEFTMOST``` bit of ```1```, left shift one, and then minus one. Please remember this wonderful trick to create bit masks with ```N``` ones at ```RIGHTMOST```, you will be able to use it later.\\n2. Negate the whole input number.\\n3. ```Bit AND``` numbers in step ```1``` and ```2```.\\n\\nThree line solution if you think one line solution is too confusing:\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int findComplement(int num) {\\n        int mask = (Integer.highestOneBit(num) << 1) - 1;\\n        num = ~num;\\n        return num & mask;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```UPDATE```\\nAs several people pointed out, we don't need to left shift 1. That's true because the highest ```1``` bit will always become ```0``` in the ```Complement``` result. So we don't need to take care of that bit.\\n\\n```\\npublic class Solution {\\n    public int findComplement(int num) {\\n        return ~num & (Integer.highestOneBit(num) - 1);\\n    }\\n}\\n```"
