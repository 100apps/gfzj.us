All my output values were correct, but the followee may change from lower case to upper case (actually I have no idea and MySQL seems to be case insensitive)\\n\\nSo finally I try another answer credit to @xiaxin and get AC.\\n```\\nselect f1.follower, count(distinct f2.follower) as num\\nfrom follow f1\\njoin follow f2 on f1.follower = f2.followee\\ngroup by f1.follower\\norder by f1.follower;\\n```"
